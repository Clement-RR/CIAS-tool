# Change Impact Simulation
## Description

This project is a comprehensive Python-based solution designed to [briefly describe the main purpose]. 
It includes modules for simulation (simulation.py), utility functions (utils.py), plotting results (plotter.py), 
and a main script (main.py) that orchestrates the entire process. 
It's ideal for [target audience or application field, e.g., academic research, data analysis, etc.].

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:
```commandline 
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you have Python 3.y installed on your system

## Usage

To use this project, run the `main.py` script as follows:
```
python main.py
```
This will initiate the simulation process, leveraging utility functions and plotting capabilities to display the 
results.

## Structure

This project is structured into several key components, each serving a distinct purpose within the overall system. 
Here's a breakdown of the main directories and files:

`main.py`: The entry point of the project. It orchestrates the execution of the simulation, utilizing functions and 
classes defined in other modules. It also handles command-line arguments to customize the simulation runs.

`simulation.py`: Contains the core simulation logic. This module defines classes and functions responsible for 
performing the simulation tasks, modeling the system, and generating simulation events or data.

`utils.py`: Provides utility functions that support various operations within the project. These functions may 
include data processing, input validation, and other helper functionalities that are reused across different parts of the project.

`plotter.py`: Dedicated to data visualization. It contains functions to plot the results of the simulation, 
making it easier to analyze and interpret the data generated by the simulation.

### Features

- **Simulation Framework**: Customizable simulation settings to model various scenarios.
- **Utility Functions**: A set of utility functions to support data processing and manipulation.
- **Plotting Results**: Visual representation of simulation outcomes for easy analysis.
- **Extensible Design**: Modular design allowing for easy expansion and customization.
